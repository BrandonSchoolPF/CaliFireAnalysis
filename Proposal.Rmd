# Proposals  

The data set in which we are choosing revolves around the forest fires that 
happened in California from 2013 to 2020.

### Predicting Correlation Using SVM & LM
Portion done by: Brandon Ly  

Brandon will be using both SVM and linear modeling in order to see if ML could
predict if the fire were major or not using acres burned, and which season the
fire took place in.  

The purpose of his experiment is to see if the season (spring, winter, etc) has a 
correlation to the acres burned. So by using ML, if the models accurately 
predict if the fires were considered to be major using the seasons, it could 
possibly mean there is a correlation to be made.

Using RMSE, alike what we did in module 10, we could compare the RMSE of both the
linear and support vector machine models to see which model were better, by 
doing so having multiple 'opinions' on the matter would be beneficial.  


### Creating Density Maps to Visualize Occurences
Portion done by: Brandon Dora

This portion of the project will be centered around taking the dataset and creating multiple geographical
representations of the data, that will not only provide a better look at the data itself, 
but will also allow the viewer to infer where these fires are more likely to occur. 

Referring back to what was accomplished in module 4, using ggmap, along with a few 
other packages, we are able to visualize our data by geographically mapping where these 
fires occured, and to go even further, we will be creating density maps to show hotspots
by the county the fires had taken place in.
